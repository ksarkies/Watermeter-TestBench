Watermeter Testbench Firmware
=============================

1. Install the latest Arduino IDE - https://www.arduino.cc/en/Guide/HomePage
2. Download RTClib https://github.com/adafruit/RTClib (a zip file download
   link is provided) and place in a directory somewhere.
3. Install the library in the Ardiuno IDE - see http://arduino.cc/en/Guide/Libraries
4. The code can be compiled and downloaded to the Arduino normally. Note that
   the Arduino time is only set at the time of downloading. If the Arduino is
   powered off and restarted, the time will be incorrect.
