Watermeter Testbench

An Arduino Uno is used with Screwshield and Sensor Shield to interface a number
of sensors in a flowbench for test and calibration of a watermeter.

Sensors are:

- FS200A flowmeter, 450 pulses per litre.
- Temperature Sensor (?).
- Solenoid operated water valve (?).
- Water pressure sensor (?).
- Start button.
- Chronodot real-time clock based on the DS3231 RTC chip.
- Watermeter photointerrupter output from comparator.

The watermeter used is that for the XBee-Acquisition project
https://github.com/ksarkies/XBee-Acquisition

Tests to be done are:
- Read the Watermeter photointerrupter output and compare with the flowmeter
  readings to identify the scaling factor for the watermeter in litre/min.
- Read the Watermeter count as processed by the Watermeter and transmitted
  serially in csv format for comparison with flowmeter readings. This will
  verify the validity of the Watermeter measurements.
- Read the Watermeter count as processed by the Watermeter and transmitted
  via the XBee to verify the system operation.

The code is for the Arduino IDE. It requires an additional subfolder "libraries"
with the following libraries:

- "RTClib" for the Chronodot RTC.
    https://github.com/adafruit/RTClib
- "Wire" for the TWI (I2C) to communicate with the Chronodot.
